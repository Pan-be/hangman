# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic hangman game written in vanilla JavaScript, utilizing an external API for word selection. You can play the game by guessing letters using your keyboard.

The game is live on Netlify at [https://hangman-pan-be.netlify.app/](https://hangman-pan-be.netlify.app/)

## How to Play

    Visit the game website at https://hangman-pan-be.netlify.app/
    The game will choose a random word from the API and display the number of letters in the word as stars.
    Guess letters by pressing keys on your keyboard.
    If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the word display.
    Keep guessing letters until you complete the word or until you make a mistake for the fifth time.
